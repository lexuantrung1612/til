# Jumping Between Sessions

If you are using tmux to manage multiple projects by putting each project in
a separate session, you may find yourself moving between sessions
frequently. Detaching and reattaching can and will get tedious. There are
better ways. tmux provides the `<prefix>)` and `<prefix>(` bindings as a way
of jumping to the next and previous session, respectively. That should
reduce some friction.
