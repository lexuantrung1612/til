# Cycle Through Layouts

Arranging a series of split windows in tmux can take some time. Once those
splits windows are arranged, it is difficult to set them up in a new way.
There is a way of cycling through layouts that might be able to help though.
Hit `<prefix><space>` over and over to cycle through the layouts until you
find the arrangement that you want.
