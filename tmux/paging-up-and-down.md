# Paging Up And Down

When in _copy mode_ (`<prefix>[`), you can move the cursor around like you
would in vim with the directional keys (`hjkl`). This works fine until you
want to move up or down through pages and pages of text, such as when
navigating to the top of a long stack trace. One way to get where you need
to be more quickly is by paging up and down.

Hit `CTRL-u` to page up and `CTRL-d` to page down.
