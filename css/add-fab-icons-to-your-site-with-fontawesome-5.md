# Add Fab Icons To Your Site With FontAwesome 5

Check out the latest version of [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

> Version 5 has been re-written and re-designed completely from scratch.

One part of the rewrite is that _brand_ icons have been organized into their
own collection. Whether you are using the full suite or just the brands
bundle, you'll be referencing these icons with the `fab` class name.

```html
<i class="fab fa-react" />
```

This will give you a React icon.
