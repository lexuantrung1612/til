# Identify Outdated Gems

Bundler can be used to identify outdated gems for a given project. By
running `bundle outdated` in a project's directory, Bundler will compare the
versions of all stated gem dependencies against the gem server and report a
list of those gems that are not up to date.

See the [Bundler docs](http://bundler.io/v1.1/bundle_outdated.html) for more
details.
