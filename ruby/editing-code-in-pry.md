# Editing Code In Pry

[Pry](http://pryrepl.org/) provides an enhanced REPL experience for Ruby.
One of the enhancements it provides is the ability to open your preferred
editor within a pry session. This makes it easy to compose and edit
multi-line blocks of code.

Try it out by typing `edit` within a pry session. Once you are ready, you
can save the file which will prompt pry to interpret the contents of your
file within the context of the pry session.
