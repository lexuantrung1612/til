# Delete To The End Of The Line

There are a number of ways to delete from the cursor position to the end of
the line. Generally when I am doing this, I want delete to the end of the
line and then start typing something different. Perhaps the best way to do
this is by hitting `C`. It deletes to the end of the line and then leaves
you in insert mode. This also makes for easier repetition with the dot
command.

This is synonymous with hitting `c$`.

See `:h C` for more details.
