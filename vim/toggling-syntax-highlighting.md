# Toggling Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting in Vim is generally a good thing, but sometimes you need
to turn it off. This can be achieved with the `syntax` command.

```vim
:syntax off
```

When you need that syntax highlighting back again, you can turn it right
back on like so:

```vim
:syntax on
```

See `:h syntax-on` for more details.
