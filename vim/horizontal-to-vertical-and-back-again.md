# Horizontal to Vertical and Back Again

If you have two Vim windows open with a horizontal split and you want to
quickly switch them to be vertically split, you can type the following two
key bindings:

```
Ctrl-w t
Ctrl-w H
```

To go from vertically split windows to horizontally split windows you can
instead use:

```
Ctrl-w t
Ctrl-w K
```
