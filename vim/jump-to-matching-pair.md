# Jump To Matching Pair

If you are dealing with code or data that contains parentheses or brackets
that are hard to follow, you can easily jump between them with `%`.

For example, if you move over a `[` and hit `%`, Vim will jump your cursor
to the matching `]`. Hit `%` one more time and it will jump back.

See `:h %` for more details.
