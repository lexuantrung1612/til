# Toggle Absolute And Relative Paths In BufExplorer

After opening [BufExplorer](https://github.com/jlanzarotta/bufexplorer)
using `<leader>bs`, you will see both files and the paths to those files. By
default you will see absolute paths to the files. You can use `R` to toggle
between relative and absolute paths.

For relative paths, the path will be relative to the current working
directory of the Vim session (`:pwd`).
