# Splitting For New Files

Let's assume you already have a vim session open. You now want to open a new
file. You can open a new horizontally split window with the `:new` command.
Alternatively, if you'd like the new window to open with a vertical split,
you can use the `:vnew` command.

See `:new` and `:vnew` for more details.
