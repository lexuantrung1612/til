# Previous Buffer

I often find myself needing to jump back and forth between two buffers. For
instance, if I am iterating on a test and the implementation, there is a lot
of switching from one to the other and then back again.

This quickest way to do this is to use the command for going to the previous
buffer. The default binding for that is `ctrl-^`.

With that binding, it is fast and easy to toggle between two buffers.
