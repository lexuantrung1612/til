# Split The Current Window

Generally when I want to open up a buffer in a window split, I use `:sp` or
`:vsp` and type out the filename. It may be a bit more convenient to use
window commands to create the splits.

To open a horizontal split:

```
Ctrl-w s
```

To open a vertical split:

```
Ctrl-w v
```

With the split made, you can use `Ctrl-o`/`Ctrl-i`,
[BufExplorer](https://github.com/jlanzarotta/bufexplorer), or whatever way
you like to navigate between buffers.
