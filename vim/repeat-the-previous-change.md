# Repeat The Previous Change

If you have just performed a change and you realize you want to immediately
do it again, you can hit `.` instead of retyping it. This is a good way to
quickly repeat simple changes.

For instance, if you are adding indentation to a code block with `>`, you
can estimate the number of indents that need to happen and type `3>` or you
can indent once and then hit `.` for additional indentation until you reach
the right level of indentation.

Check out the docs for more details: `:help .`
