# End Of The Word

Word-based movement can serve as a quick way to get around locally in Vim. I
most often use `w` and `b` for this kind of movement. While `w` and `b` move
me to the beginning of the next and previous word, respectively, I find that
sometimes it would be more convenient if I were at the end of a word.

The `e` and `ge` commands serve this purpose well. `e` will move me to the
end of the next word and `ge` will move me to the end of the previous word.
