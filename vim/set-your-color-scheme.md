# Set Your Color Scheme

Vim ships with a number of standard color schemes for both light and dark
backgrounds. You can also find and install many others. To set your color
scheme, you can use the `:colorscheme` command. You can quickly see what
color schemes are available by typing `:colorscheme` and then tabbing for
completion. For instance, you can set the *delek* color scheme by entering

```
:colorscheme delek
```

See `:h colorscheme` for more details.
