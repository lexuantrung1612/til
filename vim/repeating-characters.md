# Repeating Characters

It's not common to need to type 39 space characters in a row, but when the
moment arises, you don't want to be caught hitting the space bar 39 times.
Vim makes it easy. From normal mode, type the number, then `i`, and then the
character to be repeated followed by an escape.

For instance, for 39 spaces, hit:

```
39i <esc>
```

or for 80 dashes, hit:

```
80i-<esc>
```
