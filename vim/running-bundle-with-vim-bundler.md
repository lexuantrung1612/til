# Running Bundle With vim-bundler

The [`vim-bundler`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-bundler) plugin is a
companion of the [`rake.vim`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rake) and [`rails.vim`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails) plugins. It is a lightweight plugin that exposes some bundler-related convenience methods.

The Vim `:Bundle` command exposes the `bundle` command. To install the latest
changes to the `Gemfile`, you can invoke `:Bundle` or `:Bundle install` from
inside of Vim.
