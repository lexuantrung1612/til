# Highlighting Search Matches

Want to see all the places in the buffer that match a search pattern? Turn
on `hlsearch` and Vim will highlight all the matches of the previous search.

Try turning it on with `:set hlsearch` and then search for some pattern
using `/`.

If you no longer want to see all the highlighted matches, turn it off with
`:set nohlsearch`.

See `:h hlsearch` for more details.
