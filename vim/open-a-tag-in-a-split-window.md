# Open A Tag In A Split Window

Using tags and `ctrl-]` is a quick way to jump from the use of a keyword to
the declaration or definition whether in the same file or another file.
Sometimes what you really want is that tag definition opened up in a
(horizontal) split window. That way you can see the definition without
losing context. This can be accomplished with `ctrl-w ]`.

The Vim help file gives the following definition of this command:

> Use identifier under cursor as a tag and jump to it in the new upper window.

See `:h CTRL-W_]` for more details.
