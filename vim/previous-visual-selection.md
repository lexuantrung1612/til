# Previous Visual Selection

Typing `gv` in normal mode will re-select the previous visual selection.
This makes it easy to re-select a specific block of text. For instance, if
you are performing a search and replace on a visual selection and you didn't
get the regex quite right, you can quickly type `gv` and then edit the regex
of your previous command.
