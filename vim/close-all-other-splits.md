# Close All Other Splits

If you have a couple other splits open, but you only want the window in
focus, you may find yourself doing some finger gymnastics to navigate to
those other split windows to close out of them.

There is an easier way.

The Ex command `:only` will close all other splits, excluding the window
that is currently in focus.

See `:h :only` for more details.
