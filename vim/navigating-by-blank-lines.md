# Navigating By Blank Lines

Use vim to open a file full of code (or text) that has some blank lines.
Move the cursor to the middle of the file. Then start hitting `{` or `}`.
You'll see that the cursor jumps from blank line to blank line.

Use `{` to jump to the closest blank line _behind_ the cursor. Use `}` to
jump to the closest blank line _ahead_ of the cursor.

This may not seem like the most practical or obvious way to navigate, but it
can help move you around a bit quicker than just tapping `k` and `j`.
