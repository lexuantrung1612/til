# Open The Gemfile

One of the central files to any Ruby or Rails project is the `Gemfile`. When
it is time to add or remove a Gem, that is the place to go. The
[`vim-bundler`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-bundler) plugin allows you to
quickly navigate to the project's `Gemfile` by entering the following
command:

```
:Bopen
```

That command is primarily used for navigating to the source of a particular
Gem, but when used alone, it pops open the `Gemfile`.
