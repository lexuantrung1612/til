# Quickly Search For A Component With React DevTools

As the size of your React app grows, it can become challenging to track down
specific components within the [React
DevTools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) extension. You opened
it up with the hopes of quickly inspecting the `props` being received by a
component, but find yourself navigating through the DOM structure instead.

The React DevTools extension provides a search bar that can be used to
quickly filter out most components.

The search bar is located at the top of the extension. Once you start typing
the results are immediate. Then, if you hover over any of the remaining
components, you'll get some visual feedback as they are highlighted in the
browser.
