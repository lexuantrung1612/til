# Visually Select A React Element For Inspection

Similar to the _Elements_ tab of Chrome devtools, the [React devtools
extension](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools) provides a visual
element selector to make it easier to inspect an element you can see in the
browser.

Open the React devtools, click the crosshair icon, hover around the browser
until the element you are looking for is visually highlighted, and then
click. The React component hierarchy will be expanded to reveal that
element. You can now inspect it or quickly navigate to nearby elements.
