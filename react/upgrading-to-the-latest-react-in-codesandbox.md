# Upgrading To The Latest React In CodeSandbox

At the time of writing this, the latest version of React is 16.3.1. Opening
up [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) and starting a new React project
has us working with React 16.2.

By clicking on the _circular arrow_ upgrade icon next to `react` and
`react-dom`, we will have upgraded each to 16.3.1.
