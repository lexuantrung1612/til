# Building A React App In The Browser

There are a couple relatively new tools that give you just about everything
you need to build a React app in the browser.

The first is [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). It has a couple
pre-configured environments for different technologies. The main one is
React. CodeSandbox describes itself as such:

> an online editor that helps you create web applications, from prototype to
> deployment.

The second, which just released out of beta, is
[Glitch](https://glitch.com/) which comes with projects like
[react-starter](https://glitch.com/~starter-react) so that you can jump into
a React project that is ready to roll. Glitch describes itself as:

> the friendly community where you'll build the app of your dreams

You can quickly build and publish React apps in either of these and share
them with the world.
