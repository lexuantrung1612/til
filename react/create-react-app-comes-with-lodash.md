# create-react-app Comes With Lodash

[Lodash](https://lodash.com/) is already a dependency of
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). If you
need one of those fancy Lodash functions, there's no need to `yarn add
lodash` to your project, all you need is an import statement.

```javascript
import chunk from 'lodash/chunk';
```
