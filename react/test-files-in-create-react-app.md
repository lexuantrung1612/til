# Test Files In create-react-app

Any `.js` files placed in the `__tests__` directory will be treated as tests
by Jest when running `yarn test`. If you don't want to place all of your
files in that directory and especially if you want to co-located your test
files with the source files, you can name them with the `.test.js` or
`.spec.js` suffixes.

Any files in your create-react-app project ending in these suffixes will be
treated by Jest as test files and included in test runs.

There are [more
details](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#running-tests)
in the docs.
