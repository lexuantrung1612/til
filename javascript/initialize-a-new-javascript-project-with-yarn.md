# Initialize A New JavaScript Project With Yarn

Yarn, like NPM, has a basic command for initializing a new JavaScript
project.

```
$ yarn init
```

This will ask you a number of questions about your project like the name and
what kind of license you want to use. In the end, it just creates a
`package.json` file which can be used with `yarn` or `npm`.
