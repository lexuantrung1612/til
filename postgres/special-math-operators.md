# Special Math Operators

Postgres has all the mathematical operators you might expect in any
programming language (e.g. `+`,`-`,`*`,`/`,`%`). It also has a few extras
that you might not be expecting.

Factorial Operator:

```sql
> select 5!;
 ?column?
----------
      120
(1 row)
```

Square Root Operator:

```sql
> select |/81;
 ?column?
----------
        9
(1 row)
```

Absolute Value Operator:

```sql
> select @ -23.4;
 ?column?
----------
     23.4
(1 row)
```
